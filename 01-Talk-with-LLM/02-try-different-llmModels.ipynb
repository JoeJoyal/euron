      "The phrase \"jack of all trades and master of none\" is used to describe someone who has a broad range of skills and knowledge in many areas, but is not necessarily an expert in any one particular area. The full saying is often completed with the phrase \"but oftentimes better than a master of one,\" which highlights the idea that having a diverse set of skills can be advantageous in certain situations.\n",

      "In terms of who can become a \"jack of all trades,\" anyone can. It simply refers to someone who has a wide range of skills and knowledge, rather than a deep level of expertise in a single area. However, it is important to note that becoming a \"master of one\" typically requires a significant amount of time, effort, and dedication to a particular field or subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for who can become \"failed,\" it is not necessarily the case that someone who is a \"jack of all trades\" is more likely to fail than someone who is a \"master of one.\" Both approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses, and success or failure often depends on factors such as individual abilities, opportunities, and circumstances. It is possible for someone who is a \"master of one\" to fail in their chosen field, just as it is possible for someone who is a \"jack of all trades\" to succeed in multiple areas. Ultimately, the key to success is finding what works best for each individual and pursuing it with determination and passion.\n"
