Our current methods deplete vital water resources and depend on pesticides that inflict damage on the environment, signaling a need for change.\\n\\nLocalized Production, Global Vulnerability\\n\\nA glaring example of our food systemâ€™s fragility is seen in the United States, where over 90% of its leafy greens are produced in just two statesâ€”California and Arizona. This concentration not only poses a risk to US food security but also highlights a global challenge. Countries, especially those in the Middle East with a heavy reliance on food imports, find themselves at risk of supply disruptions.

The growing area is periodically flooded with the nutrient solution, submerging the plant roots. After a set period, the nutrient solution is drained back into the reservoir, allowing the roots to receive oxygen.
